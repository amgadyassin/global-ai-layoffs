## 🎯 Business Goals

| # | Goal | KPIs |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | Which industries were most affected? | Total layoffs by industry, avg layoffs per company |
| 2 | How did layoffs trend over time? | Quarterly trends, year-over-year changes |
| 3 | Are AI companies more resilient? | Avg % workforce laid off (AI vs Non-AI) |
| 4 | Which cities & countries had the highest reductions? | Total layoffs by country, top 10 cities |
| 5 | Which funding stages are most vulnerable? | Avg layoffs by stage, layoff event frequency |

## 📓 Notebooks

### `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
- Handles missing values with industry/stage median imputation
- Fixes data types (`pct_workforce`, `raised_mm`, `date`)
- Standardizes text fields and categorical columns
- Engineers date features (`year`, `month`, `quarter`, `year_quarter`)
- Exports cleaned dataset ready for analysis

### `02_data_visualization.ipynb`
- 8 interactive Plotly charts covering all 5 business goals
- Layoff trends over time, top industries & companies
- Global choropleth map, AI vs Non-AI resilience comparison
- Funding stage bubble chart showing risk vs frequency

### `03_dashboard.ipynb` — Dashboard V1
- Year range slider, industry, country & company type filters
- 4 live KPI cards (total layoffs, companies, top industry, top country)
- Line chart, top companies bar chart, world map, bubble chart

### `04_dashboard_v2.ipynb` — Dashboard V2
- Advanced layout with drill-down treemap by industry → company
- Quarterly trend with 2-quarter rolling average overlay
- AI vs Non-AI grouped bar chart by year
- Rotatable orthographic globe choropleth
- Top 10 cities bar chart

## 🔍 Key Findings

| Insight | Finding |
|---------|---------|
| Worst year | 2023 — driven by post-pandemic over-hiring correction |
| Peak quarter | Q1 2023 — highest single quarter in tech layoff history |
| Most affected industry | Consumer & Retail |
| Highest layoff country | United States |
| Most vulnerable stage | Post-IPO companies had the highest total layoffs |
| AI vs Non-AI resilience | Non-AI companies showed slightly higher avg % workforce reductions |

## 🚀 How to Run

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amgadyassin/global-ai-layoffs.git
cd global-ai-layoffs
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Set up your Kaggle API credentials**

This project uses a `.env` file to keep credentials secure. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_kaggle_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_kaggle_api_token

> 🔑 Get your token from [Kaggle → Settings → API → Create New Token](https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account)
> The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` — your credentials will **never** be pushed to GitHub.

**4. Download the dataset**

The dataset is fetched automatically when you run `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` via the Kaggle API. It will be saved as `layoffs_events.csv` inside the `data/` folder.

> If you prefer to download manually, get it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/belbino/global-ai-layoffs-and-job-market-2020-present) and place it in `data/` as `layoffs_events.csv`.

**4. Run the notebooks in order**

| Notebook | Output |
|---|---|
| `01_data_cleaning.ipynb` | Generates `global_ai_layoffs_cleaned.csv` |
| `02_data_visualization.ipynb` | Static EDA charts |
| `03_dashboard.ipynb` | Dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8050 |
| `04_dashboard_v2.ipynb` | Dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8051 |
